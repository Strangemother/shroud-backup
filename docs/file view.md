 content, namely _store_. When selecting a file, the action panel also presents
 file specific actions such as "to Photo Storage" for images or "preview" for audio.

chosen items into _pockets_ for late actions. Conceptualised as a _shopping cart_ with a user marking many files to perform bulk actions.
