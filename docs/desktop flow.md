## Initial Welcome

A user enters the desktop app. First time load will ask for an app name (identity) and a  list of target drives.

Once the user selects the target disks, the 'configure' panel for each drives alters how the monitor tracks files.



## Drive Configure

2. A single drive config may track the 'default' or a custom config.
3. A custom config _Appends_ to the default.


## Options

General options for a 'drive'


### Track Changes

Track the changes made to files; created, updated, and deleted. Given the

Upon a file update perform the _instruction manual_ for the asset type. This may be one of the core functions, and any file associated actions. They include:

1. Perform a patch difference
2. Send the file off local
3. Record and report


### Remote Backup

Primarily Shourd performs offsite backsups of drives and directories for short and long-term storage. When a file is flagged for offline storage the partial or full content transmits to a designated location. This may be another network machine or online file storage service.

The builtin remote services default to Strangemother Hot and Cold Store, mixing with compute nodes.
